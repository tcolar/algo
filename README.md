algo
====

This is nothing useful but myself doing some algo exercises for practice since this
is the kind of stuff asked in interviews but not necessarely used everyday in the field.

* List
* Stack
* Heap
- Tree
  - Binary search
- Graph
  - Dijkstra

- Sorts / Big O
  - Bubble sort -> On2 / On2
  - Insertion sort -> On2 / On2
  - Selection sort -> On2 / On2
  - Quicksort -> OnLogn / On2
  - Merge sort -> Onlogn / Onlogn can parallel
  * Heap sort -> OnLogn / OnLogn
  - Radix / Bucket sort -> Onk

- Concurrency
  - Go mutex
  - Go routines / channels

- Design Patterns
