This is some work and exercises I'm doing fllowing the book:
 "Algorithms Fourth Edition" (Robert Sedgewick | Kevin Wayne)

While I've been programming for 20 years I never had much formal school training
and it was not in English, and over time I've forgot some of the teminology and such.

Tech interviews tend to fcus very heavily focus on academic type algorithm
questions so this makes it a great idea to refresh for sure.
