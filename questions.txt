# Arrays
1.1 implement an algo to determine if a string has all unique chars. What if you cannot
use an additional data struct ?
1.6 given an image represented by an N*M matrix where each pixel in the img is 4
bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do it in place ?

# Linked lists
2.4 write code to  partition a linked list around a value , such as all nodes
less than x come before all nodes greater than x.
2.7 Implement a function to check if a linked lits is a plaindrome


# Stack / Queues
3.1 describe how you could use a single array to implement 3 stacks
3.5 Implement a quque class which implements a queue using 2 stacks

# Trees/ graphs
4.1 impl a func to check if a bin tree is balanced.
blanaced tree is defines as a tree such as heighth of 2 subtrees of any node
never differ by more than one
4.2 Given a directed graph design an algo to find if their is a route betwen 2 nodes
4.5 Implement a funtion to check if a binary tree is a binary search tree

# Math and probability
7.7 Design algo to find kth number such as only prime factors are 3,5,7

# Recursion / dynamic prog.
9.1 a child running up staird with n steps and hope 1 to or 3 steps.
implement method to count how many ways he can run up the stairs for n.
9.5 Write a method to return all permutations of a string

# scale
10.6 if you where designing a web crawler how would you avoid getting n infinite loop

# sorting & searching
11.2 write method to sort array of strings so all anagrams are next to each other
11.4 How would you sort 20GB file with one string per line.
11.6 given n*m matrix in which rows and cols are sorted in asc order write method to
find an element

# Extra
17.2 algo to find if somebody won tic tac toe
17.12 algo to find pair of ints in an array which sum to given value
18.6 func to find smallest 1 million numbers out of 1 billion(memory fits 1 billion)
18.8 n*m matrix of postive and negative numbers find submatrix with largest sum.
